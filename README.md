Tis is a script that notifies you via email when a specific record is found on Discogs, under the given alert price.

- Download the script and set a CRON to run it every x hours
- DB of records to track is in the script itself

**Improvements:**
- Add seperate file for DB
- Create UI:
  - list records from db
  - add, update, delete records from db
  - log visualization for debugging
